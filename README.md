# Piper PA-12 For Sale

Daily aggregator of Piper PA-12 aircraft classified listings from
[Barnstormers.com](https://www.barnstormers.com), published as a static page
(`docs/index.html`) meant to be embedded via `<iframe>` on taildraggers.com.

## How it works

- `scraper/barnstormers.py` reads Barnstormers' **Piper PA-12 Super Cruiser** category
  (`category-21191-Piper--PA-12-Super-Cruiser.html`) and walks every page of it: the category
  pager is built from a `?seocategory=<path>&page=N` pattern, so the scraper requests
  page 1, 2, 3, ... until a page turns up no new ads. It then visits each listing's
  detail page to pull out the price, location, and posted date (falling back to regex
  heuristics over the visible text since the site doesn't expose structured data). The
  title is derived from the listing URL's own SEO slug, since every detail page shares
  one generic `<title>`/`<h1>`.
- Only whole-aircraft-for-sale listings are published. The category also carries
  engine and parts ads, so each ad's title must name the airplane - a PA-12 model code
  (`PA-12`, `PA12`, `PA-12S`) or "Super Cruiser"; a title naming the PA-12 is kept even
  when it mentions the Super Cub parts many PA-12s carry. See
  `_PA12_RE`/`_SUPER_CRUISER_RE` in `scraper/barnstormers.py`. Titles that read as
  parts, accessories, services, or raffles are dropped (phrases like "on floats" are
  allowed - see `ALLOWED_PHRASES` in `scraper/common.py`). Every surviving listing's
  title is rewritten to a canonical **`YEAR Piper PA-12 Super Cruiser`** form (or
  `PA-12S` for the seaplane), leaving the year off when the ad doesn't state one.
- Ads priced under $1,000 are dropped as parts listings (`MIN_AIRCRAFT_PRICE` in
  `scraper/common.py`).
- `main.py` runs the scraper, de-duplicates results (including the same ad reposted
  under a new ad number: identical title, price, and location), and renders them into
  `docs/index.html` titled **"Other Piper PA-12 Ads on the Web"**, with one row per
  listing: Title (linked to the original ad), Price, Location, Date Posted, and Site
  Posted On. Links use `rel="noopener noreferrer"` and the page sets a
  `no-referrer` meta policy, so Barnstormers never sees that the click came from
  taildraggers.com.
- `.github/workflows/daily-scrape.yml` runs the whole thing once a day (13:00 UTC),
  commits the regenerated `docs/index.html` if it changed, and can also be triggered
  manually from the Actions tab (`workflow_dispatch`).

## One-time setup: enable GitHub Pages

This repo publishes `docs/index.html` as a plain static file — GitHub Pages just needs
to be pointed at it once:

1. Go to **Settings → Pages** in this repository.
2. Under **Build and deployment → Source**, choose **Deploy from a branch**.
3. Branch: `main`, folder: `/docs`. Save.
4. GitHub will publish the page at `https://taildraggers.github.io/piper-pa12-for-sale/`
   (may take a minute or two the first time).

## Embedding on taildraggers.com

```html
<iframe
  src="https://taildraggers.github.io/piper-pa12-for-sale/"
  title="Other Piper PA-12 Ads on the Web"
  style="width: 100%; height: 800px; border: 0;"
  loading="lazy">
</iframe>
```

## Running locally

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```

This writes/overwrites `docs/index.html`.

## Notes

- If Barnstormers changes its markup or is briefly unreachable, the run logs will
  show a `[warn]`/`[error]` line pointing at what broke rather than failing silently.
- The scraper identifies itself with a browser-like `User-Agent` and adds a short
  delay between requests to be polite to the site.
